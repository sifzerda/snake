## (1) Description

Part of my personal project to create a react MERN stack app which has a number of basic games. I used trial and error and ChatGPT prompting. 

As this is a fairly simple game, it didn't need to be broken up into multiple build stages as the previous games. It started with a moving snake, configuring snake movement/physics, and then adding snake growth dynamic.
 
Lessons learned from building this project:

- Not all moving bodies/objects in matter.js need physics, and there are alternate ways of creating 'non-physics' objects in matter.js.  
- Using react reducers and zustand
- Matter.Query and Matter.Bounds instead of a 'collision' fx for more precise collision detection

## (4) Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sifzerda/snake.git
cd snake
npm install
npm run start
```

## (5) Usage

Parts:
 
 - Start screen
 - Game
 - Final score page + score submission
 - High scores page
 - If logged on: profile page with User scores.

## (6) Dev Stuff: Building:

### Tech used:
- ~~React-Spring~~ this was used but replaced with matter.js
- ~~React transition group~~ replaced with matter.js
- Matter.js
- useHotkeys: hook for handling movement controls, (not essential, can manage with switch statement)
-  zustand: handles react reducers to manage game state
-  ~~useSound: add audio fx~~ uncommented

Early version of game made using react-spring, but this played out frame-by-frame and lacked the physics and animation dynamics. 

Matter.js had an issue where the snake segments had their own physics and collision with the snake head, which caused erratic movement with more segments. Changed this so UseState tracks the head and copy/spread the snake head so segments mirrored the head and did not operate independent of the head.

Also had an issue implementing collision between snake head and body; since head is always touching body this constantly triggered game over for snake running into itself. I tried making tiny detection objects inside the head and segments but this created issues. Had to limit collision to head-to-segment, not segment-to-segment, and exclude the first 10 segments (since physically impossible for snake head to touch those anyway).

1. <u>'useState':</u> useStates track the snake head, food, and matter.js engine;
2. <u>'const head':</u> Creates the snake head;
3. <u>'const foodObject':</u> creates static 'sensor' food objects;
4. <u>'const handleKeyDown':</u> sets movement controls;
5. <u>'const updateSegments'</u> adds segments to snake, spreading existing snake. Segment parts are copies of the head which mirror the head movement;
6. <u>'const checkCollision':</u> handles collision between snake head and food objects; food is removed and reset to a random position, and a segment is added to the snake head;
7. <u>'const newSegment':</u> segments are 'sensors' so they do not interfere with snake head physics.
8. <u>'const useGameStore':</u> game state reducer managed by zustand.
9. <u>'const boundaries':</u> creates invisible walls around game screen border.
10. <u>'const checkFoodCollision', 'checkWallCollision', 'checkSegmentCollision':</u> handles collision between snake head and food objects, and between snake head and wall boundaries, and between snake head and new segments (excluding first 10 segments);
11. <u>'const emojiCanvas':</u> makes food object an apple emoji with styling;
12. <u>'const handleDirection':</u> controls velocity per movement direction;
13. <u>'const updateSegments':</u> adds and updates segments to snake body on eating.

### Alternate Config:

Originally put in a 'restart game' button inside game. Putting in a FinalScore page made this redundant. It's there for a version of the game with no game over screen. Currently commented out and also saved inside /copies/(11)MJSnake.jsx.

## (7) Bugs: 

- Sometimes after game over and visiting highscore page or submitting score, if you return to the main menu and click 'start game' it'll return you to the previous score submission page. Fixed by refreshing page or clicking one of the log in tabs and then returning to game tab.

## (8) To do: 

- [x] create moving snake
- [x] create food which randomly resets position once 'eaten'
- [x] segments add to snake;
  - [x] segments added to snake don't interfere with movement physics;
- [x] add render.sprite to snake head, segments, and food
- [ ] ~~difficulty ramp: snake moves faster as it gets longer~~
- [x] score with food eaten
- [x] timer for game session
- [x] highscores
- [x] main screen
- [x] submit score
- [ ] ~~exit game from game screen~~
- [x] profile highest scores display
- [x] make window/device size responsive
